# databas_gym

# Project Idea
For this assignment I have designed and implemented a database to store dat regarding members, employees, membership and class workout at a gym.
A gym has many members and employees and it can be very difficult to keep track of everything and everyone that concerns the gym. By having collected data for each category, it will be easier for gym employees to obtain information about a member, about their membership and their contact information. It will be easier to fins out which place and which instructor a certain session has. All in one place.
